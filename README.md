The submitted Python code was written in Google Colab as a Jupyter notebook.  
The code should be opened in Google Colab with the attached data document in the same folder.
The data document is called "apparel-test.dat".
The data file has not been modified at all and is exactly as provided to us prior to cleaning the data which we do in the code.

Add this "apparel-test.dat" file to your google drive. 
The file path should work unless you nest the file into a folder to which you'll need to update the "mount" code with the correct file path.
Once the file has been uploaded to your Google Drive and the Python code has been opened in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, simply run all.

You will be prompted to allow access to your Google Drive, accept as necessary.
In Google Colab, you can then click the "Files" icon on the left hand sidebar to view the "data.csv" file that has now been written with cleaned data, and all visualization images.

Feel free to reach out should you have any issues or have any questions.
